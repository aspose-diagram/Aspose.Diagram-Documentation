## **Creating the Hello World Application**

The steps below creates the Hello World application using the Aspose.Diagram API:

1. Create an instance of the Diagram class.
1. ApplyÂ the license:
   1. If you have purchased a license, then use the license in your application to get access to Aspose.Diagram' full functionality
   1. If you are using the evaluation version of the component (if you're using Aspose.Diagram without a license), skip this step.
1. Create a new Visio file, or open an existing Visio file.
1. Create a new text box.
1. Insert the words **Hello World!** into a text box.
1. Generate the modified Microsoft Visio file.

The implementation of the above steps is demonstrated in the examples below.

### **Code Sample: Creating a New Diagram and Writing Hello World!**

The following example opens an existing Microsoft Visio template file named "[Basic_Shapes.vss](Basic_Shapes.vss)", inputs "Hello World!" text in the first page and saves the diagram.
