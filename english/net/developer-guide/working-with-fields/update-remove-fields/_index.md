## **Update Field**
Aspose.Diagram for .NET lets you update and remove [field](https://reference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/field) to Microsoft Visio diagrams from within your own applications, without Microsoft Office Automation. 

The [Field](https://reference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/field) object represents text field in a [text](https://reference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/text) run. The field property, exposed by the [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) class supports a collection of Aspose.Diagram.Field objects.
