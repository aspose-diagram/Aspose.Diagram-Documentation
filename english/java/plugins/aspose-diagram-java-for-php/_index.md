PHP Java Bridge is a bridge program that connect between PHP and Java with Java Native Interface. Rake + PJB is the more powerful and useful build tool than both Maven and Ant. You can test your Java business logic class itself with PJB's mock. It helps to migrate Struts's Model Object into your RoR application. But beware to buildSwing application, PHP (and PJB) doesn't consider JVM's native threads handling.
