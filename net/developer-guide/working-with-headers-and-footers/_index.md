[Aspose.Diagram for .NET](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/net) provides a mechanism for setting headers and footers of the Microsoft Office Visio diagrams. Developers can get or set the text string that appears on the left, center and right side of a document header/footer. They can also set header and footer margin along with the font properties of the text.
