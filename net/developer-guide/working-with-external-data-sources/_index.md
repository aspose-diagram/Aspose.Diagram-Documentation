## **Edit SQL Server Data Connection and Refresh Record Sets**
Aspose.Diagram API allows users to edit SQL Server data connection and refresh all the record sets. To bring data into the Visio drawing, we need access to the SQL Server data. Make sure that the database is not opened in exclusive mode.
### **Update Data Connection and Record Sets**
It's now a common phenomena to link the data of Microsoft Visio diagrams from the external data sources. The [DataConnectionCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/dataconnectioncollection) class contains all the data connections.
#### **Programming Sample**
The following piece of code edits a particular data connection and also refresh all the available record sets in the Visio diagram.
