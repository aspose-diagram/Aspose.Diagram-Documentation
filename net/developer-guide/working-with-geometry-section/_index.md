## **Edit Connector Geometry Section in the ShapeSheet**
Any shape in Microsoft Office Visio is composed of one or more “geometries”. Each geometry represents a different component of the shape. Most shapes have just one geometry, but some have two or more. Aspose.Diagram APIs allow developers to manage these geometries programmatically.
