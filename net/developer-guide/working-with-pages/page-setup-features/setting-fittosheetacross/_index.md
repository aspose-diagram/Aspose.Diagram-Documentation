Page setup options are fully supported in Aspose.Diagram. This article explains how to set page options with Aspose.Diagram and shows code samples for setting:

Aspose.Diagram provides a class, [**Page**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/page), that represents a Microsoft Visio file. The [**Diagram**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/page) class contains a [**Pages**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/pagecollection) collection that allows access to each page in the Visio file. A page is represented by the [**Page**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/page) class.

The [**PageSheet**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/pagesheet) class provides the [**PrintProps**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/pagesheet/properties/printprops) property that is used to set the page setup options of the page. In fact, this [**PrintProps**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/pagesheet/properties/printprops) property is an object of the [**PageSheet**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/pagesheet) class used to set different page layout options for a printed page. The [**PrintProps**](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/net/aspose.diagram/pagesheet/properties/printprops)  class provides various properties used to set page setup options.
