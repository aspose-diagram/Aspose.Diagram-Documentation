## **Retrieving Master Information**
A shape master is another name for a Visio stencil. With Aspose.Diagram, it is possible to retrieve information about pages, connectors and also masters. This article explains how to get the ID and name from a diagram.

The [Master](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/master) object represents a [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) object's master in a diagram. The Masters property, exposed by the Diagram class, supports a collection of Aspose.Diagram.Master objects. This property can be used to retrieve the mastersâ€™ information that is, the master ID and name. Use the Page.Shapes property to determine which shape has been inherited by the master shape.
### **Retrieving Master Information Programming Sample**
The following piece of code retrieves the masters information from a diagram.

## **Add Master from the Stencil of Shapes**
A stencil is a collection of shapes associated with a particular Microsoft Office Visio template. With Aspose.Diagram, it is possible to add any shape master to a drawing from a stencil.
### **Add Master**
The [Master](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/master) object represents a [Shape](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/shape) object's master in a diagram. The AddMaster method, exposed by the Diagram class, allows adding a master from a stencil. It offers the following four ways:

- Stencil file path and master ID.
- Stencil file path and master name.
- Stencil file stream and master ID.
- Stencil file stream and master name.
- Add master to diagram from source diagram
#### **Add Master Programming Sample**

## **Create Master from Scratch**
Aspose.Diagram API allows to create a [Master](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/master) from scratch without any stencil, drawing or template. Developers can customize the creation of Master. The AddMaster method, exposed by the Diagram class, allows to add a master.
### **Create Master Programming Sample**

## **Get a Master from the Visio File**
Sometimes, developers need to get the details of a Visio drawing's master. The Aspose.Diagram API supports this feature.

Aspose.Diagram for .NET offers the [Diagram](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/diagram) class that represents a Visio drawing. The Masters property, exposed by the Diagram class, supports a collection of Aspose.Diagram.Master objects. This property can be used to retrieve a particular master's details. The MasterCollection class exposes the GetMasterByName and GetMaster methods which can be called to get a Master object.
### **Getting a Master Object by ID**
This example work as follows:

1. Create an object of the Diagram class.
1. Call the Diagram.Masters class' GetMaster method.
#### **Master Object by ID Programming Sample**
The following example shows how to get a master by ID from a Visio drawing.

### **Getting a Master Object by Name**
This example work as follows:

1. Create an object of the Diagram class.
1. Call the Diagram.Masters class' GetMasterByName method.
#### **Master Object by Name Programming Sample**
The following example shows how to get a master object by name from a Visio drawing.

## **Check Presence of a Master in the Visio Drawing**
The Aspose.Diagram API supports checking for the presence of a master in a Visio drawing. With the MasterCollection property, developers can check to see if a master is present by its name or ID.

Aspose.Diagram for .NET offers the [Diagram](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/diagram) class that represents a Visio drawing. The Masters property, exposed by the Diagram class, supports a collection of Aspose.Diagram.Master objects. This property can be used to check for the presence of a particular master. The MasterCollection class exposes the IsExist method which can be called with the master name or ID parameter.
### **Checking a Master Presence by ID**
This example work as follows:

1. Create an object of the Diagram class.
1. Call the Diagram.Masters class' IsExist method.
#### **Master Presence by ID Programming Sample**
The following example shows how to check presence of a master by ID in a Visio drawing.

### **Checking a Master Presence by Name**
This example work as follows:

1. Create an object of the Diagram class.
1. Call the Diagram.Masters class' IsExist method.
#### **Master Presence by Name Programming Sample**
The following example shows how to check a master presence by name from Visio drawing.
