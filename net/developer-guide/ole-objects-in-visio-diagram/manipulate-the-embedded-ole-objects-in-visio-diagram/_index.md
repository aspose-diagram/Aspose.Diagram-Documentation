Microsoft Office Visio supports manipulating the OLE objects in the Visio diagram. If an visio file resides outside of the Visio drawing and developers need to add a feature in their .NET applications to auto insert these files inside of the drawing, they can achieve this by using [Aspose.Diagram for .NET API](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/net/).

## **Manipulate the Embedded OLE Objects Programming Sample**
[ObjectData](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/foreigndata/properties/objectdata) property of the [ForeignData](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/foreigndata) class allows developers to manipulate with existing OLE objects in Visio diagram. This help topic demonstrates how developers can retrieve an OLE object of the Word document, edit it using [Aspose.Words for .NET API](https://products.aspose.com/words/net), and then save back as an OLE object in the Visio diagram.
