## **Add Hyperlink to a Visio Shape**
It is an easy approach to add hyperlink to Microsoft Visio shape dynamically.

On multi page Visio drawings, hyperlinks can move you from one page to another. You also can link your drawing to a web page or a file on your system.

These properties are exposed by the [Shape](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/Shape) class supports the [com.aspose.diagram.Hyperlink](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/hyperlink) object. The add method can be used to add a shape's hyperlink data.

To identify properties in Microsoft Visio:

1. In a diagram, right-click a shape.
1. Select **Hyperlink**.
1. Set existing properties
1. Press **OK** button

## **Get Hyperlinks Data of the Visio Shapes**
It is possible to get a shape's hyperlink data in a similar way that you [reading Visio shape data]().

Developers can retrieve all hyperlinks from a Visio shape in the same way as they [read Visio shape data]() using [Aspose.Diagram for Java API](https://products.aspose.com/diagram/java)

In multipage Visio drawings, hyperlinks can move you from one page to another. You also can link your drawing to a web page or a file on your system.

These properties are exposed by the [Shape](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/Shape) class supports the [com.aspose.diagram.Hyperlink](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/hyperlink) object. The property can be used to read a shape's hyperlink data.
