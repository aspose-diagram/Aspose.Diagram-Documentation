## **Rotate a Shape with Suitable Angle**
Aspose.Diagram for Java allows you to rotate a shape to any angle. The SetAngle method exposed by the [Shape](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/shape) class can be used to rotate a shape to any desired angle. It takes a single parameter as an angle.
### **Rotate a Shape Programming Sample**
Use the following code in your Java application to rotate a shape using Aspose.Diagram for Java.

## **Change the Position of a Shape**
The Shape Class allows you to change the position of a shape. The connector line automatically adjusts when the shape is moved to a different position.

The Move and MoveTo methods, exposed by the Shape class, support changing the position of a shape as a part of a group or not.
The code examples in this article move a shape on the page.

The process for moving a shape is:

1. Load a diagram.
1. Find a particular shape.
1. Move shape to a different location
1. Save the diagram.
### **Change Position Programming Sample**
The code snippet below shows how to move the shape. The code retrieves a Visio page by name and shape by ID 16, and moves its position.

## **Connect Sub-shapes of the Groups**
This topic elaborates how to connect two sub-shapes of two different group shapes in Microsoft Visio diagrams using Aspose.Diagram for Java.

The ConnectShapesViaConnector method exposed by the [Page](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/page) class can be used to connect the shapes by their IDs. The AddShape method, exposed by the [Diagram](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java) class, can be used to add a shape.

The code below shows how to:

1. Load a sample file.
1. Access a particular page.
1. Add dynamic connector shape to the selected page.
1. Connect sub-shapes
### **Connect Sub-shapes Programming Sample**
Use the following code in your Java application to connect the sub-shapes of two different group shapes using Aspose.Diagram for Java.

## **Get the Shapes Connected to a Particular Shape**
[Add and Connect Visio Shapes](/diagram/java/add-and-connect-visio-shapes/) explains how to add a shape and connect it to other shapes in Microsoft Visio diagrams using Aspose.Diagram for Java. It is also possible to find shapes that are connected to a specific shape.

The ConnectedShapes method exposed by the [Shape](https://apireference.aspose.com/diagram/java/com.aspose.diagram/shape) class can be used to get the IDs of the shapes connected to a shape. The GetShape method, exposed by the [ShapeCollection](http://www.aspose.com/api/java/diagram/com.aspose.diagram/classes/shapecollection) class, can then be used to find a shape by its ID.

The code below shows how to:

1. Load a sample file.
1. Access a particular shape.
1. Get the names of all of the shapes connected to the selected shape.
### **Get Shapes Programming Sample**
Use the following code in your Java application to find all the shapes connected to a specific shape using Aspose.Diagram for Java.
