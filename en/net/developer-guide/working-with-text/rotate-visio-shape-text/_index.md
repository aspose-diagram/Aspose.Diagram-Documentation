## **Creating a Diagram**
Aspose.Diagram for .NET lets you read and create Microsoft Visio diagrams from within your own applications, without Microsoft Office Automation. The first step when creating new documents, is to create a diagram. Then [add shapes and connectors](https://docs.aspose.com/diagram/net/add-retrieve-copy-and-read-visio-shape-data/) to build up the diagram. Use the default constructor of [Diagram](http://www.aspose.com/api/net/diagram/aspose.diagram/diagram) class to create a new diagram.
