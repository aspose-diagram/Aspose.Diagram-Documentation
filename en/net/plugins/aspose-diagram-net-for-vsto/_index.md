# **What is VSTO?**
VSTO, or Visual Studio Tools for Office, or Microsoft Visual Studio Tools is part of Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET tools suite and supports the Microsoft .NET Framework. It is used by developers to write code connecting Microsoft Office Word, Excel and Outlook applications. Developers using VSTO can employ C# or Visual Basic languages. It is an alternative to Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA.
# **Aspose.Diagram for .Net**
Aspose.Diagram is a class library for working with Microsoft Visio files. It allows developers to work with VSD, VSDX, VSS, VST, VSX, VTX, VDW and VDX files on C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET web applications, web services, Mono and Windows applications. It allows you to open files and manipulate the elements of the diagram, from lines and fills, to more complex elements, and then export to VDX, VSX, VTX, XPS, HTML, SVG, SWF, XAML, image or PDF formats.
# **Aspose.Diagram for VSTO**
## **Introduction**
The developers looking for file format libraries may need to walk through the features provided by the libraries available on the market. Mainly, two factors are considered when choosing an option:

- Features
- Efforts required to use the library

If you are a .NET developer looking for faster,easy and light-weight file format library to process files, you may need to compare VSTO(Visual Studio tool for Office) with Aspose. In this case, this project will help you to compare features and code in both libraries.
