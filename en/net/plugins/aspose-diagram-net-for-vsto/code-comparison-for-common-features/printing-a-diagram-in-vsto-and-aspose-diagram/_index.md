## **VSTO**
Below is the code to show how to print diagram:

{{< highlight cs >}}

   Application.ActiveDocument.Print();

{{< /highlight >}}
## **Aspose.Diagram**
Printing of the diagram to the **default printer** is quite simple in Aspose.Diagram for .NET. Perform the following steps in order to print the diagram to default printer:

- Create an instance of Diagram class to load a diagram that is to be printed
- Call the Print method with no parameters as exposed by the Diagram object

Printing of the diagram to the **specific printer** requires the name of the printer as parameter to the Print method of the Diagram. Perform the following steps in order to print the diagram to the desired printer:

- Create an instance of Diagram class to load a diagram that is to be printed
- Call the Print method of the Diagram class with printer name as string parameter to the Print method

Below is the code of using default and specific printer:

{{< highlight cs >}}

  string FilePath = "demo.vsd";

 //Load the diagram

 Diagram diagram = new Diagram(FilePath);

 //Call the print method to print whole Diagram to the default printer

 diagram.Print();

 //Call the print method to print whole Diagram to the desired printer

 diagram.Print("LaserJet1100");

 PrinterSettings settings = new PrinterSettings();

 settings.PrinterName = "LaserJet1100";

 //Call the print method to print whole Diagram to the desired printer and set document name in print job

 diagram.Print(settings, "Job name while printing with Aspose.Diagram");
